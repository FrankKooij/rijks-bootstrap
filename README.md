The Rijkshuisstijl is the official style guide for apps and sites in the Dutch public sector. In this package, Bootstrap is adapted to the style guide.


## Using Rijks-Bootstrap

Include the stylesheets, fonts, images and javascript libraries in dist/. For an example, check sample-login.html and sample-ui-elements.html.

## Building

The package uses Gulp to build LESS, concatenate styling and the required javascript libraries. To build the package, run:

```bash
npm install
```

To watch for file changes and build on the fly:

```bash
gulp
```

## Licence
